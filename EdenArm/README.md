# Eden Arm
Cyberneticians want cost effective, next gen robotics in their studios. 
They want robotics platforms in other people's studios.
The Eden Arm is a 10x "evolution" on the MK2 arm concept.


# Key Result:
- Eden Arm plays ball with Zeus the Poodle.
- The product is emperically 10x better than the best consumer cybernetic/robotic arm out there.
- Gets Grant Cardone's attention and onto his outstream
- Kickstarter or something?! Some mandated "Bring To Market" deployment 
- 1,000$ profit


# The Ecosystem:
- a market (digital and physical) for cybernetics relating to / using / collaborating with Eden Arm
- scad files for Eden Arm (to be used on the market)
- software (to be given on the market via NFT)
- YouTube
- Instagram
- Twitch? (each product line should probably get all their own streams
- Eden Arm game? Perhaps a cross-cutting segment of the full borgs game? That would be rad.
- Voxel Game that allows you to design parts and then move them in game and IRL? Seems fun.


# Side Quests:
- Give an Eden Arm to Matt Pitlik
- Ship an Eden Arm to TN for Christmas

The TA1 is the first iteration in Tree's commercial line of robot arms. The TA0 was sold to several 


# Current Stats:
~ 200$* cost with (50$ margin * 20 sales) = 1000$
- Manufacturing frequency ~2/day
- Total manufacturing time 20units * 1day/2units = 10 days

   Notes:
     - 200$cost/50$ margin is 25% margin. BJ Henrici reccomends 50% margin (his corp is botique)

Problems:
- SOLVED Eden Cybernetics: 
     It needs a new name. Unitree is a robotics company. "Tree" will be confused with that company.
     New name meditation: edencybernetics.com/arm (BOOM)
